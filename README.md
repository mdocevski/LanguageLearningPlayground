# LanguageLearningPlayground
A playground project for trying out new technologies, techniques and methodologies.

The application itself allows the user to create a personalized dictionary to help with their language studies.

TODO: 
- Add multiple foreign language support / Language switching
- Caching (Doesn't seem necessary for now)
- Access to online translation service 
- Dependecy injection
- Repository pattern (if caching is needed)

New things tried out:
- Architecture components:
  - LiveData
  - ViewModel
  - Room database
- Kotlin coroutines
